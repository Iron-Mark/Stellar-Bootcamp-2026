---

## Deployment of your Smart Contract

Install the following before starting:

- **Rust** — [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- **Stellar CLI** — [Install guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/install-cli)
- **wasm32 target:**
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Verify your CLI is installed:
```bash
stellar --version
```

---

## Step 1 — Add Testnet Network

Register the Stellar testnet as a named network so you can reference it by name in subsequent commands:
```bash
soroban network add \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015" \
  testnet
```

Verify it was added:
```bash
stellar network ls
```

Expected output:
```
testnet
```

---

## Step 2 — Generate and Fund a Keypair

Generate a local keypair named `alice` and fund it automatically via Friendbot (testnet faucet):
```bash
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund
```

Confirm the address was created:
```bash
stellar keys ls
stellar keys address alice
```

Expected output:
```
alice
GBXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

> **Note:** `alice` is just a local alias. You can name it anything — `deployer`, `admin`, `mykey`, etc. The `--fund` flag only works on testnet.

---

## Step 3 — Build Your Contract

From your contract's root directory, compile it to WebAssembly:
```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Your compiled artifact will be at:
```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<your_contract_name>.wasm
```

**Example** — for a contract named `hello-world` in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

The wasm output will be:
```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_world.wasm
```

> **Note:** Rust converts hyphens to underscores in filenames. `hello-world` → `hello_world.wasm`.

---

## Step 4 — Deploy to Testnet

Deploy the compiled wasm to the Stellar testnet:
```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<your_contract_name>.wasm \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet
```

**Example:**
```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_world.wasm \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet
```

On success you will see:
```
ℹ️  Uploading contract WASM…
ℹ️  Simulating transaction…
ℹ️  Signing transaction: 3d5ad32df06ca6...
🌎 Sending transaction…
✅ Transaction submitted successfully!
🔗 https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/3d5ad32df06ca6...
✅ Deployed!
CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

The last line is your **Contract ID** — save it, you will need it for all invocations.
```bash
# Save it as a variable for convenience
export CONTRACT_ID=CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
=======
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/stellar-cli):

```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

- [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app) - browser extension, set to **Testnet**

### Step 2 - Get Your Assigned Contract

Your facilitator will share the assigned smart contract during the session.  
Clone or copy the starter contract into your local machine:

```bash
git clone <facilitator-provided-repo-link>
cd <contract-folder>
```

### Step 3 - Complete the Contract

Open `src/lib.rs` and complete the contract logic as instructed.  
Make sure you also have at least **3 passing unit tests** in `src/test.rs`.

Run tests locally:

```bash
cargo test
```

All tests must pass before you proceed.

### Step 4 - Deploy to Stellar Testnet

**Configure your Stellar CLI identity (first time only):**

```bash
stellar keys generate --global my-key --network testnet
stellar keys address my-key
```

**Fund your testnet account:**

```bash
stellar keys fund my-key --network testnet
```

**Build your contract:**

```bash
stellar contract build
```

**Deploy to testnet:**

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<your_contract>.wasm \
  --source my-key \
  --network testnet
```

Copy the **Contract ID** from the output - it looks like: `CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

**Verify on Stellar Expert:**

```text
https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/<YOUR_CONTRACT_ID>
```

### Step 5 - Submit on Rise In

Go to your Rise In program page and submit the following:

| Field | What to Submit |
|-------|----------------|
| **GitHub Repository** | Public repo link with your contract source code |
| **Contract ID** | Your deployed testnet contract address |
| **Stellar Expert Link** | `https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/<CONTRACT_ID>` |
| **Short Description** | 2-3 sentences on what your contract does |

## 📁 Required Repo Structure

Your GitHub repository must follow this structure to qualify:

```text
my-soroban-contract/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs        # Your completed contract logic
│   └── test.rs       # At least 3 passing unit tests
├── Cargo.toml
└── README.md         # Brief description of your contract
>>>>>>> 08aeb8a (add)
```

---

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Step 5 — Initialize Your Contract

Most contracts have an `initialize` or constructor function that must be called once after deployment. Use `stellar contract invoke` to call it:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- <function_name> \
  --<param_name> <param_value>
```

**Example** — initializing a contract with an admin address:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin $(stellar keys address alice)
```

**Example** — initializing with multiple parameters:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin $(stellar keys address alice) \
  --token CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC \
  --max_amount 1000000
```

> **Note:** The `--` separator between the CLI flags and the contract function arguments is required.

---

## Step 6 — Invoke Contract Functions

Call any contract function the same way:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- <function_name> \
  --<param> <value>
```

**Example** — calling a `hello` function that takes a `name` parameter:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- hello \
  --name world
```

Expected output:
```json
["Hello", "world"]
```

**Example** — calling a read-only `get_balance` function:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_balance \
  --address $(stellar keys address alice)
```

**Example** — calling a function with a boolean parameter:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- set_active \
  --enabled true
```

**Example** — calling a function with an integer parameter:
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- set_limit \
  --amount 5000
```

---

## Step 7 — Verify on Explorer

After deploying, verify your contract is live using either of these tools:

**Stellar Expert:**
```
https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/<CONTRACT_ID>
```

**Stellar Lab:**
```
https://lab.stellar.org/r/testnet/contract/<CONTRACT_ID>
```

Both show your contract's transaction history, storage state, and invocation logs.

---

## Tips and Troubleshooting

**`contract missing metadata section`**

Your contract is missing the `contractmeta!` macro. Add this to your `lib.rs`:
```rust
use soroban_sdk::contractmeta;

contractmeta!(
    key = "Description",
    val = "Your contract description here"
);
```

Then rebuild and redeploy.

---

**`src refspec master does not match any`**

You have no commits yet. Run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

**`error: src refspec main does not match any`**

Your local branch is `master` not `main`. Run:
```bash
git push -u origin master --force
```

Or check your current branch:
```bash
git branch
```

---

**`transaction simulation failed: HostError`**

Usually means the contract function arguments are wrong. Double-check:
- Parameter names match exactly what is in your contract
- The `--` separator is present before function name
- Types match (e.g. passing a string where an address is expected)

---

**Friendbot / funding issues**

If `--fund` fails, fund manually:
```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=$(stellar keys address alice)"
```

---

**Check account balance**
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <NATIVE_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- balance \
  --id $(stellar keys address alice)
```

---

## Quick Reference
```bash
# Add network
soroban network add --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015" testnet

# Generate keypair
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund

# Build
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Deploy
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<contract>.wasm \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet

# Invoke
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source-account alice \
  --network testnet \
  -- <function> --<param> <value>
```
